IMPORTANT: HOW TO FIX "MISSING DLL" ERROR
===========================================

If you still see "unknown keyword loadgame" or missing DLL errors, do this:

1. Copy ALL `.dll` files from this package into your MAIN Quake 2 folder.
   (Next to `q2pro_update.exe` and `quake2.exe`).

2. Copy ALL `.dll` files from this package into your `baseq2` folder as well.
   (Next to `gamex86.dll`).

3. Ensure `gamex86.dll` is in `baseq2`.

Summary: Just copy all `.dll` files to BOTH folders (Main folder AND baseq2 folder).
Then run `q2pro_update.exe`.
